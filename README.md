Redux Introduction For People Who Know Just Enough React To Get By

Thanks to [Peter Daily](https://github.com/thepeted) for providing the entire code, i am just disecting it and creating different versions, starting from the first with an basic code, and finishing with the last that has the complete project.

Zed Shaw, the author of “Learn Code the Hard Way” series, recently wrote an excellent blog post called Early v.s. Beginning Coders. In his post, Zed criticizes programming educators who claim that their materials are for “beginners”, but in reality are incomprehensible for most “total” beginners.

In this tutorial, I’m targeting  people who know just enough Redux to get by. Examples of people who might fit in this category would be:
## Required Knowledge:

- Beginning developers who have completed basic React tutorials online.

- Beginning developers who know just enough Redux to create an ToDo List.


### If youre are not one of this here are some recomended tutorials:

#Let's begin!

Now that you know enough Redux to get by, we can begin working. Once you have installed all packages, inside ../src/js you will find folders with all the versions of the client.js. Just replace existing client.js and you are good to go.

## Installation

Download the repository to your computer and follow the usage guide below.

## Usage

Get a React and Redux environment set up quickly with this boilerplate.

It includes all the modules you need. All you need to do is download the project, unzip it, run node and start building.
First install everything then run the webpack dev server

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will get your app running on http://localhost:8080

Webpack will watch for changes and update the browser when a file is changed.

Use src/js/client.js to import your modules into. This compiles to src/client.min.js, and is loaded into index.html.
